# hosting-a-webserver-using-CloudFormation
This template sets up a VPC infrastructure with public and private subnets, an internet gateway, NAT gateway, and EC2 instances for a web server and a database server. The web server serves a basic webpage displaying a message, and the database server is in a private subnet. The security group allows access to SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS for the instances.
